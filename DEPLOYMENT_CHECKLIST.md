# Deployment Checklist for Render.com

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Setup (Completed)

- [x] Created `render.yaml` configuration file
- [x] Fixed module type warnings in package.json
- [x] Successfully built production version
- [x] Updated README.md with deployment instructions
- [x] Verified build output in `dist/` directory

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Your Code

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Render.com deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Render.com

1. Go to https://render.com and sign in (or create an account)
2. Click **"New +"** button in the top right
3. Select **"Static Site"**
4. Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already
5. Select this repository: `PersonalWebsite`
6. Render will auto-detect the `render.yaml` configuration
7. Click **"Create Static Site"**

### 3. Configuration Details

Render will automatically use:
- **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `./dist`
- **Auto-Deploy**: Enabled (deploys on every push to main)

### 4. Post-Deployment

- Your site will be live at: `https://[your-site-name].onrender.com`
- You can customize the site name in Render dashboard
- Every push to your main branch will trigger an automatic rebuild

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If the build fails:
- Check the build logs in Render dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- Verify Node version compatibility (Render uses Node 18+ by default)

## 📝 Notes

- The `dist/` folder is git-ignored and will be rebuilt on each deployment
- Static sites on Render's free tier may spin down after inactivity
- First deployment typically takes 2-3 minutes
